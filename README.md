# 2022TTP-Application-Project
Students will be submitting this project as a qualifier for the 2022 cohort for the Tech Talent Pipeline. 
All applicants must submit a completed project in order to be considered for the program. Those who successfully complete this project will move on to the last and final part of the application process, the interview process.

# Introduction
This project will build on the technical and non-technical skills that you have learned up to now:

Building Web sites with HTML and CSS
Using JavaScript to make Web sites interactive
Fundamental UI/UX principles
Developing your personal brand and online profiles
You'll use these skills to build an MVP of your personal web site. This Web site is a place to show the tech industry who you are and what you can do.

By the time you are job ready, your personal site will probably use additional technologies and skills we have not covered yet. 
For now, this project will be an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that you can continue to enhance during the course.

# Examples
These sample project is far from perfect. You do not need to copy any specific feature here. You can and should use your own creativity!
